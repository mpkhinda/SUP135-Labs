## Question 1: Exploring the Opportunity Atlas (Washington, DC)  

This screenshot from the Opportunity Atlas website shows household income at age 35 for children of low-income parents in Washington, DC. The census tract where I grew up (tract 11001000600) is highlighted with a black outline.

## Question 2: Identifying Missing Data

```{r missing data}
# Calculate total number of missing values
total_NA <- sum(is.na(atlas))
# Locate columns that contain missing values, count, and create dataframe
cols_NA <- data.frame(as.list(colSums(is.na(atlas)))) %>% 
           pivot_longer(everything(), 
                        names_to = "variable", 
                        values_to = "missing_vals")
```

There are `r total_NA` missing values in the Opportunity Atlas dataset.   
They appear in the following variables: 
```{r print NA list}
knitr::kable(cols_NA)
```

## Question 3: Absolute Mobility at the 25th Percentile

#### 3a: Units  
In the Opportunity Atlas dataset, Absolute Mobility at the 25th percentile (kfr_pooled_pooled_p25) is measured as a percentile rank within the national household income distribution as measured in 2014-2015 tax data. In this sense, it does not measure an absolute amount of income in dollars but rather shows how the average income in that tract compares to the rest of the country.

#### 3b: Interpreting values
In this variable, higher values signify greater economic outcomes and upward mobility. For example, a value of 100 signifies that the average income in that tract for someone born to parents at the 25th income percentile falls in the top 1% of incomes in the nation. Conversely, a value of 0 would indicate that the average income in that tract for that same group falls in the bottom 1%. 

#### 3c: Rationale for using a linear model



## Question 4: Histogram of Absolute Mobility at the 25th Percentile
```{r mobility hist}
ggplot(data = atlas) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = kfr_pooled_pooled_p25), fill = "black", bins = 100) + 
  labs(title = "Distribution of Mean Income Percentile Rank for Children of Low-Income Parents", y = "Number of Census Tracts", x = "Mean Income Percentile Rank") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=18,hjust = 0.5))
```

## Question 5: Summary Statistics for Absolute Mobility at the 25th Percentile
```{r mobility summary stats}
# Get summary stats
sumStats_absMob_25 <- summary(atlas$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25)
# Add standard dev to summary stats
sumStats_absMob_25["Std. Dev"] <- sd(atlas$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)

sumStats_absMob_25
```

## Question 6: Extreme Values
One of the limitations of a linear model is that it establishes a uniform and continous relationship between the predictor variable and the response variable. As such, it does not account for or respect particular upper or lower bounds — in this case the 100th and 0th percentile respectively. So, there may be cases where a certain input returns a value above the 100th or below the 0th percentile, as we see in the summary statistics for the kfr_pooled_pooled_p25 variable above. 


## Question 7: Home Tract Comparison of Absolute Mobility at the 25th Percentile
```{r mobility home tract}
DC_atlas <- subset(atlas, state == 11)
tract_atlas <- subset(atlas, state == 11 & tract == 600)

full_mean <- mean(atlas$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
dc_mean <- mean(DC_atlas$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
tract_mean <- tract_atlas$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25
```
In my home tract, the average income percentile rank reached by someone born to parents at the 25th percentile of income is 51.78702, which is higher than both the state average of 37.31235 and national average of 42.85813.

## Question 8: Home County Standard Deviation for Absolute Mobility at the 25th Percentile
```{r mobility sd home county}
# Using just state dataframe because state and county are the same for DC
dc_sd <- sd(DC_atlas$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
full_sd <- sd(atlas$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
```
The standard deviation of kfr_pooled_pooled_p25 in my home county is 6.406956, which is also the standard deviation for the state because the District of Columbia only contains one county. This is less than the standard deviation of kfr_pooled_pooled_p25 in the national dataset of 7.126422. From this measure we can conclude that the distribution of outcomes is more narrowly concentrated in DC than in the United States as a whole. 


## Question 9: Upward Mobility & Rent

#### 9a: Plotting County-Level Absolute Mobility at the 25th Percentile vs Rent
```{r mobility rent plot}
ggplot(data = DC_atlas, aes(x = kfr_pooled_pooled_p25, y = rent_twobed2015)) + 
  geom_point(size = 1) + 
  geom_text(aes(label=tract), size=2.5, nudge_y = -50) +
  labs(title = "Mean Income Percentile Rank for Children of Low-Income Parents vs. Rent in Washington, DC", x = "Mean Income Percentile Rank", y = "Average Rent for Two-Bedroom Apartment in 2015") +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size=18,hjust = 0.5))
```

#### 9b: Reflections
The line of best fit in the plot above shows that there is a positive correlation between rent and mean income percentile rank, meaning that rent is typically higher in tracts with better economic outcomes for children of low-income parents. However, it is apparent that there is quite a lot of variance at the individual tract level. There are some tracts (tract 202) where rent is significantly higher than predicted based on the observed economic outcomes, while other tracts (tract 1402) cost significantly less than expected for their economic outcomes. 

#### 9c: Identifying “Opportunity Bargains”
```{r mobility rent bargains}

```

In order to determine if a particular tract is an "opportunity bargain" we can compare the rent predicted by the linear model (based on observed economic outcomes) and the reported rent for that tract. If reported rent is below predicted rent then we can say the tract is in fact an "opportunity bargain."

In the scatter plots above, a number of interesting economic and demographic trends are apparent. First, we notice in the comparison of poverty rates bewteen 2010 and 1990 that 


## Question 11: Redlining

#### 11a: HOLC Grades and Upward Mobility
```{r holc grades}
HOLC_A <- subset(atlas, HOLC_A> 0.5 & !is.na(HOLC_A))
HOLC_B <- subset(atlas, HOLC_B> 0.5 & !is.na(HOLC_B))
HOLC_C <- subset(atlas, HOLC_C> 0.5 & !is.na(HOLC_C))
HOLC_D <- subset(atlas, HOLC_D> 0.5 & !is.na(HOLC_D))

mean_A <- mean(HOLC_A$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
mean_B <- mean(HOLC_B$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
mean_C <- mean(HOLC_C$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
mean_D <- mean(HOLC_D$kfr_pooled_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
```
There is a clear correlation between a higher HOLC grade and greater economic mobility in a given census tract in the United States. Tracts with a majority of the area graded A had a mean kfr_pooled_pooled_p25 value of 44.0140, those majority graded B had a mean value of 42.4677, those majority graded C had a mean value of 39.8727, and those majority graded D had a mean value of 36.1583. 

#### 11b: HOLC Grades and Racial Composition of Tracts
```{r holc blk pop}
mean_blk_A <- mean(HOLC_A$share_black2000, na.rm = T)
mean_blk_B <- mean(HOLC_B$share_black2000, na.rm = T)
mean_blk_C <- mean(HOLC_C$share_black2000, na.rm = T)
mean_blk_D <- mean(HOLC_D$share_black2000, na.rm = T)
```
The share of Black residents in a census tract is correlated with HOLC grades. Tracts with a majority of the area graded A had a mean share_black2000 value of 0.2008, those majority graded B had a mean value of 0.2886, those majority graded C had a mean value of 0.3334, and those majority graded D had a mean value of 0.4659. It is fair to say then that this could be a confounding variable in determining the effect of HOLC grades on economic outcomes since we also know that economic outcomes in tracts that are highly segregated or have a high share of Black residents tend to be below average. 

#### 11c: HOLC Grades and Upward Mobility Disaggregated by Race
```{r hold race mobility}
mean_blkMob_A <- mean(HOLC_A$kfr_black_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
mean_blkMob_B <- mean(HOLC_B$kfr_black_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
mean_blkMob_C <- mean(HOLC_C$kfr_black_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
mean_blkMob_D <- mean(HOLC_D$kfr_black_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)

mean_whtMob_A <- mean(HOLC_A$kfr_white_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
mean_whtMob_B <- mean(HOLC_B$kfr_white_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
mean_whtMob_C <- mean(HOLC_C$kfr_white_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
mean_whtMob_D <- mean(HOLC_D$kfr_white_pooled_p25, na.rm = T)
```
By analyzing measures of Absolute Mobility at the 25th Percentile disaggregated by race we can remove this potential confounding effect and start to better understand the direct relationship between HOLC grades and economic mobility. Because we are comparing the same mobility measure in the same tracts for both White and Black residents, we can then determine if the direction and magnitude of correlation between HOLC grades and outcomes is similar for both groups. Tracts with a majority of the area graded A had a mean kfr_black_pooled_p25 value of 34.4376 and kfr_white_pooled_p25 value of 50.3644, those majority graded B had  mean values of 34.5071 and 48.7535 respectively, those majority graded C had mean values of 33.2393 and 46.3272 respectively, and those majority graded D had mean values of 31.6186 and 44.1159 respectively. From this comparison we can conclude that there is a correlation between HOLC grades and economic outcomes for both Black and White residents, where outcomes increase as the HOLC grade increases (A being the highest), though the magnitude of the effect is much larger for the White population than the Black population.  


#### 11d: HOLC Grades and Environmental Characteristics
```{r holc env}
# Vegetation by HOLC Grade
mean_veg_A <- mean(HOLC_A$vegetation, na.rm = T)
mean_veg_B <- mean(HOLC_B$vegetation, na.rm = T)
mean_veg_C <- mean(HOLC_C$vegetation, na.rm = T)
mean_veg_D <- mean(HOLC_D$vegetation, na.rm = T)

# Extreme heat by HOLC Grade
mean_heat_A <- mean(HOLC_A$extreme_heat, na.rm = T)
mean_heat_B <- mean(HOLC_B$extreme_heat, na.rm = T)
mean_heat_C <- mean(HOLC_C$extreme_heat, na.rm = T)
mean_heat_D <- mean(HOLC_D$extreme_heat, na.rm = T)

# Developed land area by HOLC Grade
mean_dev_A <- mean(HOLC_A$developed, na.rm = T)
mean_dev_B <- mean(HOLC_B$developed, na.rm = T)
mean_dev_C <- mean(HOLC_C$developed, na.rm = T)
mean_dev_D <- mean(HOLC_D$developed, na.rm = T)
```
In keeping with Hoffman, Shandas, and Pendleton's hypothesis, these data show that negative environmental characteristics do correlate with lower HOLC grades. The mean values for vegetation, extreme heat, and fraction of land area developed by HOLC grade are displayed here:

```{r holc env table}
# Create dataframe to display results
holc_df <- data.frame(c("A", "B", "C", "D"),
                       c(mean_veg_A, mean_veg_B, mean_veg_C, mean_veg_D),

                       c(mean_dev_A, mean_dev_B, mean_dev_C, mean_dev_D)) 
names(holc_df) <- c("HOLC_grade", "vegetation", "extreme_heat", "developed")
